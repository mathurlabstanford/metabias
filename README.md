`metabias` provides common components (classes, methods, documentation) for
packages that conduct meta-analytic corrections and sensitivity analyses for
within-study and/or across-study biases in meta-analysis. As a user of those
packages, you are unlikely to need to use this package itself directly.

See the packages:
- [`PublicationBias`](https://github.com/mathurlabstanford/PublicationBias)
- [`phacking`](https://github.com/mathurlabstanford/phacking)
- [`multibiasmeta`](https://github.com/mathurlabstanford/multibiasmeta)
